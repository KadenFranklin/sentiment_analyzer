From what i remember the book starts off on a positive note with Huck-finn having a large sum of money to his name, and just goofing around with his friends playing pirates. The first downward turn (around 1000) probably represents Hucks father coming back and being the generally abusive drunk that he is. After that huck runs away with Jim. They spend their time on a raft on the mississippi river. They have various adventures and encounters on the river, and this takes up the majority of the book. Some of their adventures are fun, others are life threatening for them. But all in all they both grow as people on the raft and come to appreciate one another. Towards the end of the book (around 3000) they end up caught between a feud of two families. There is a signigicant amount of drama, death, and destruction in this part of the book, which is represented by the sharp decline in both graphs. At the end of the book Huck-finn reunites with Tom sawyer, and they learn that Hucks dad is dead, and that jim is now a free man. The end of the book leaves the characters with few remaining problems, so it is appropriate that the graph ends in a sharp upwards turn.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
